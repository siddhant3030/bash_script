# Shell Script has many operators that you can use to test different aspects of a file.
#  For example, you can use the -e operator to ensure that a file exists before deleting it.
#   Or, you can check that a file can be written to before appending to it.
#    By checking the feasibility of the impending file operation,
#     you can reduce the number of errors that your program will encounter.
